Instructions:

1) To replicate data processing, shapefile pre-processing, and run the Shiny App locally, click on Sandusky.Rproj. Once R has opened, go to the bottom right "Files" window, open final_data_processing.Rmd and shapefile_processing.Rmd. You will run the files in that order. Click "run all" at the top with the green triangle. App.R can be run at any time. Click "run" at the top with the green triangle.


2) The directory as available here is slightly different than the directory bundle as uploaded as uploaded to RShinyApps.io. For reference (if the app or basis needs to be altered and reuploaded) that bundle differs from the existing directory as shown here by deleting the "external" folder (located at data/source/external) and the "Sandusky Bay Pathway" folder (located at data/source/city)
