Information about the disturbance type and the resulting change to vegetation life-form or tree canopy cover are used to characterize this change. This layer is generated concurrent with the updating process using tables and a series of database queries on a spatial overlay of vegetation and disturbance raster data. Data Summary: In order to keep LANDFIRE vegetation data products current, subsequent versions of these data are updated with mapped occurrences of known disturbance and severity. For LF2010 vegetation data, these mapped occurrences include a time period from 2001-2010. The mapping process integrates disturbances mapped using remote sensing of landscape change paired with user contributed polygons with management activities over this two year period. The effect of these disturbances on the vegetation are modeled or predicted using a series of tables that link pre-disturbance existing vegetation type, height, and cover and a range of possible disturbance types and severities with post-disturbance existing vegetation type, height, and cover. For forested vegetation, these tables are informed by computer simulations in the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS, www.fs.fed.us/fmsc/fvs/) while for non-forest vegetation, they are informed by a series of simple rule-sets generated heuristically for each individual map zone. Final updating occurs when the tables are linked with a spatial overlay of vegetation and mapped occurrences of disturbance and used to assign LF2010 existing vegetation, height, and cover. Finally, a unique code is assigned to all pixels that associate them with a particular disturbance type as well as categories of change magnitude expressed either in a change in vegetation life-form or a change in tree cover.</abstract>      <purpose>LANDFIRE data products are designed to facilitate national- and regional-level strategic planning and reporting of management activities. Data products are created at a 30-meter grid spatial resolution raster data set; however, the applicability of data products varies by location and specific use. Principal purposes of the data products include providing, 1) national-level, landscape-scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and, 2) consistent fuels data to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. Users are advised to evaluate the data carefully for their applications.</purpose><supplinf></supplinf>    </descript>    <status>      <progress>Complete</progress>      <update>None planned</update>    </status>    <spdom>      <bounding><westbc>-82.9568157727</westbc><eastbc>-82.2753234638</eastbc><northbc>41.5462208014</northbc><southbc>41.2156040825</southbc></bounding>    </spdom>    <keywords>      <theme>        <themekt>None</themekt>        <themekey>Raster digital data</themekey>        <themekey>LF_1.2.0</themekey>        <themekey>LANDFIRE</themekey>        <themekey>USFS</themekey>        <themekey>GIS</themekey>        <themekey>LANDFIRE 2010</themekey>        <themekey>United States Forest Service</themekey>        <themekey>USGS</themekey>        <themekey>Vegetation Transition Magnitude</themekey>        <themekey>VTM</themekey>        <themekey>U.S. Geological Survey</themekey>      </theme>      <theme>        <themekt>ISO 19115 Topic Categories</themekt>        <themekey>imageryBaseMapsEarthCover</themekey>        <themekey>environment</themekey>      </theme>      <place>        <placekt>U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995, Countries, dependencies, areas of special sovereignty, and their principal administrative divisions, Federal Information Processing Standard 10-4,): Washington, D.C., National Institute of Standards and Technology</placekt>        <placekey>US</placekey>        <placekey>United States</placekey>        <placekey>U.S.</placekey>        <placekey>Alaska</placekey>      </place>    </keywords>    <accconst>None</accconst>    <useconst>Although LANDFIRE products are delivered as 30-meter pixels, they should not be used at the individual pixel level or on small groups of pixels. LANDFIRE products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub-regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LANDFIRE products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use. Further investigation by local and regional experts should be conducted to inform decisions regarding local applicability. However, it is the responsibility of the local user, using LANDFIRE metadata and local knowledge, to determine if and/or how LANDFIRE can be used for particular areas of interest. LANDFIRE products are not intended to replace local products, but rather serve as a back-up by providing wall-to-wall cross-boundary products. It is the responsibility of the user to be familiar with the value, assumptions, and limitations of LANDFIRE products. Managers and planners must evaluate LANDFIRE data according to the scale and requirements specific to their needs.</useconst>    <ptcontac>      <cntinfo>        <cntorgp>          <cntorg>Wildland Fire Science, Earth Resources Observation and Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey</cntorg>        </cntorgp>        <cntpos>Customer Service Representative</cntpos>        <cntaddr>          <addrtype>physical</addrtype>          <address>47914 252nd Street</address>          <city>Sioux Falls</city>          <state>SD</state>          <postal>57198-0001</postal>          <country>US</country>        </cntaddr>        <cntvoice>605/594-6151</cntvoice>        <cntfax>605/594-6589</cntfax>        <cntemail>helpdesk@landfire.gov</cntemail>      </cntinfo>    </ptcontac>    <datacred>Data have been collected and analyzed by teams at both USGS EROS, Sioux Falls, SD and at the USFS, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Missoula, MT.
